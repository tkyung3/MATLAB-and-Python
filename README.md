# MATLAB-and-Python

This workshop shows how to have MATLAB interact with Python.

## Agenda

Engineers who rely only on Python may find themselves encountering difficult or challenging tasks when it comes to embedded applications, building interactive dashboards, parallelizing applications, and deep learning.  Contrarily, MATLAB is a full-stack advanced analytics platform that empowers domain experts to rapidly prototype ideas, validate models, and push applications into production with ease.  However, sometimes it is advantageous to integrate MATLAB and Python together.  One example being the need to combine MATLAB's vast library of advanced analytics capabilities with supplemental models available in the open source community.  Another, using Python as a language that is well suited to pipe data between different IT systems or the web.

There are several ways to integrate MATLAB and Python together either as R&D tools or as scalable components of your production infrastructure.  The latter giving business users and decision makers immediate access to many of MATLAB's built in analytics capabilities from deep learning, optimization, signal and image processing, computer vision, data mining, time-series forecasting, embedded code generation, and more.

In this session we demonstrate the many ways in which MATLAB and Python can interface and integrate with each other.

Highlights include:

* Calling Python libraries directly from MATLAB
* Calling a live MATLAB session from Python
